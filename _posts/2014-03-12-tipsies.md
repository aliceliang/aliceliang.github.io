We worked on tipsies and got a new quickstep today.

Three steps to excellent quicksteppy tipsies:

- quick steps.  You are leaving your foot as soon as you get to it.  Keep your feet outside of you, and don't try to sway/tip outside of your base.

- Inside/outside of the turn matters a lot here as well.  Always be going forward, for both.  Make sure that you notice your space.

- Broken sway is what makes it look like the traditional quickstep tipsy.  To do this, you break your side and send it down.  You can't travel very much at all.  Be careful about taking your center away.  The best way to not do that is to always be going forward, keep space in mind, and don't think about staying where you are (but you will, anyway, if you do the other things that were mentioned).
