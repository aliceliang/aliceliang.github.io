It would be a true statement to say that as a result of dancing, I have become more self aware, a better communicator, and better at identifying the root cause of issues.

## Communication

For a long time, dancing with my dance partner was like writing code, submitting it, and then getting a code review immediately, which was usually a -2.  Then we'd argue about the validity of the comments, and then resubmit another patch.

For a long time, it was because of not properly communicating the feature that we were trying to implement, so there was a lot of passive aggressiveness that arose from not wanting to be the one that couldn't fulfill the request.  What really needed to happen was to agree on the features.  And in dance, features are about how to use space, energy, time, and weight, and more importantly, how to use them together.

Now my dance partner and I agree on the features, and what it can be limited to.  I think having a limitation on the feature requests have been good for our dancing.  We can't go too long without a lesson, or else we get strange ideas into our heads on what we should be doing.  When we can't agree, that's when it should be brought up at a lesson.  We shouldn't be aiming to give each other tasks, to fix each other.  That is the role of the instructor, because we'll probably fuck it up somehow.  The teacher might tell you to do the same exact thing that your partner told you (and you probably didn't understand and responded badly), but he'll tell you do it with some nuance or perspective that your partner didn't have.

It took about two years for us to get to this point of communication, but I think that I am much better at it now.  Communication is really just about what you want the other person to understand, and more importantly, how to negotiate what you want with them, so both of you can be happy.

## Balance

There are many different kinds of balance in ballroom dancing.  Personal balance, balance in the couple, balance in motion.

Personal balance is just your own balance, and you should be highly sensitive to when you are unbalanced.  You should be able to move freely in any direction from your standing foot while being relaxed.  We can define imbalance to be not just when your standing leg cannot support yourself, but also to be when your standing leg cannot *comfortably* support yourself.  This means that if any portion of your body feels tense when you're dancing, you're probably off balance, but not enough to tip over or fall.

Balance in the couple is coordinating your movement with your partner's.  This is really important because if this doesn't happen, then you will take your partner off balance.  And we all want to be balanced, because that is what looks and feels good in dance.  When there is couple balance, then they are sharing momentum, and this is the essense of dance: sharing a connection.  It is all the better when you have great lines when you're doing it.

How we achieve balance is through motion, and not through being static.  When you feel off balance, the easiest thing for you to do is to go along with it.  If you try to stay where you are, you'll spend a lot of energy trying to stay on your foot, and then the next steps won't have the same power or drive as you would have otherwise.  Then when you feel off balance, just go with it and then you have a better opportunity to recover.  The other important idea of balance in motion is that it will feel natural and effortless when you are doing that.  And that is how dance should feel.  You should not be trying to resist your body's movement, or else you'll take yourself off balance.  I may be repeating myself here, but they're very similar views on achieving balance through movement.

Here I've been talking about balance in your body (and your partner's), but I think this is really applicable to one's own life.  It's impossible to create couple balance if you don't have your personal balance, because you'll always be throwing your partner off.  It's important to keep moving to maintain balance, and to not be static.  It's important to always be growing and to be moving, whether it be forwards and backwards.  Never stay in the same place, or else you'll expend extra energy getting to the next place.

## Energy

When you dance, it's important to share your energy and momentum with your partner, or else you'll be using your arms to fight/argue about the direction in which you want to go.  It's also necessary such that one partner doesn't end up doing all the work in terms of moving the couple on the floor.
