When you watch us dance quickstep, the main thing you will notice is probably that it is well danced, but look nothing like quickstep.  Our quickstep looks like a goddamn waltz.

Two main things:

Up to each other, and agile.

Whoever going backwards is leading.

The other things that we covered:

Don't cross your steps.  You should be going straight, and not turning.

Use your feet, but your posture should stay up to each other.  POSTURE UP!!! At each step, you should already be preparing to get to the next one, instead of just falling.  Foot should go with body, but not after the body.

Quickstep mentality/feeling.

I think based on this lesson, we should split our practice into two parts: going slower to make sure that we are up to each other, not turning inside the partnership, stepping out straight, the person going backwards doing the leading; the other part should be dancing quickstep like a quickstep.
