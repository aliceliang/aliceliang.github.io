Both of us need to sit in comfy arm chairs.

You should wait more

In the tango back promenade, partner needs to show me the direction before transferring any weight.  What he was doing before was that he was changing the direction after transferring the weight.  (this also applies to any backwards figure he is leading)

In waltz, for the outside spin, it should be curved more.  He waits or something?  Anyway it feels different, and I exit with right side sway.  Then there is the sway to get into promenade position.  In the fallaway slip pivot exiting from wing position, I am kind of on the outside of the turn for a little bit, but I need to stop and wait for the partner, so that we can get into fallaway position.  Then I need to make sure that I am using my left side to turn my partner around me.  He needs to not try to turn around me, and should be pulled by me. She told him to start his sway earlier, and not to trick me with direction, and then things were fine after that.

No more tricks with regard to direction.

In foxtrot feather finish, partner needs to stay longer on his right leg longer, and then I can get around him. In the reverse turn, I need to start extending my right foot as I exit the figure.  I also need to monitor the partner as he gets around me.

Make sure that you are extending your foot out when you are going forward, either in promenade, or from something else, so that you are not tipping.

We did a lot of communication therapy, her translating what I mean to what should happen.  I should use her words for what I feel so that he knows what I'm talking about.
