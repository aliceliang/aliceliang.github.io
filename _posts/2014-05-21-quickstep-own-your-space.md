Today was quickstep. It started out with redoing parts of the quickstep routine.

Always assume closed until you are opened.  Partner will have to use his left hand (entire frame, really) to open you to pronmenade in the roly poly figures in quickstep.

Apparently I am too forward.  Spine should go back, and front should stay with partner.  Don't shake your head.  Be on your own weight.  Partner can come to you.  Weight on the balls of your feet.

To stay one with the partner:
- don't turn away from the center, especially on left turning figures.
- use your feet; feel your partner's feet so that you're not going away from the center by lowering too fast or too early.
- hands need to stay connected to feet.

Left turns are hard.  There is an exercise we can do, to prevent partner's left side from turning away; partner should still turn to the right when we are doing left turning figures.

Partner should be deliberate with direction.  Never turn away from the partner (and vice versa) so that it is clear where you are going.  Don't ever shuffle, because that just confuses the partner.

Next time: remind tomas to go over direction.
