Today had lesson with teacher and we discussed how to use our energy and center more efficiently.  And more importantly, with less drama.  Drama is all posturing with no action.  Basically, we hold too much because we try to maintain the lines, and that comes at a cost of no movement, which is where the good stuff is.  Then you are dancing, instead of holding.

We also talked about the importance of personal balance, and to worry less about couple balance for now.  Being personally off balance is not just when you are pulled of your feet, but also when you feel like your top is holding to compensate for other imbalances.  Make sure that you make note of that when it happens.

I don't think we can stress enough about giving your partner your hands.  This results in better lines automatically, because then you're not holding your lines.  Instead, you're thinking about where your partner is, and that helps with monitoring your action.

There is going, and there is monitoring your partner.  And you must do both.  Otherwise if there is only going, then you'll leave your partner behind, ignore your partner, and partner will be very unhappy, and possibly angry.  If all you do is monitor your partner and there is no going, then your partner cannot go.  Then partner will also be very unhappy, blocked and probably angry as well.  Therefore you must do both.  :( and it's hard.

MONITOR YOUR PARTNER!!!

Just some quick figures that we went through:

&raquo; Tango fallaway reverse slip pivot: make sure that you are almost pulling your partner on the 3rd step, so that you are actually getting out of his way.  This will make the dancing more dynamic.

&raquo; Waltz whisk: make sure that you're not collapsing your side when going back.  Also wait/monitor when going forward, but be sure not to kick partner, so that partner does not get off balance.   When exiting the whisk into outside chasse, make sure that you're taking your center with you.

Some other notes:

&raquo; Partner should stop dancing with such drama, and to just do it.  Also partner moves his head too much, and should just keep it still.

&raquo; Partner went more, but gave me his hands, and that was much easier to dance with.

&raquo; When partner opens himself for the figures going into promenade makes it a lot easier to dance those figures.

&raquo; Don't forget the feeling for the outside spin.

&raquo; Really don't underestimate how good the dancing feels when you are going AND monitoring.  So important and so difficult to keep in mind.

&raquo; Remember remember remember the feeling of GOING in tango.  It will make it a lot easier.
