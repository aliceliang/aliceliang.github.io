It would be a true statement to say that as a result of dancing, I have become more self aware, a better communicator, and better at identifying the root cause of issues.

For context, here's my dance background.  In high school, I took a high school dance class to get out of physical education classes.  Then I took a ballet class at my dance studio with a friend.  When I got to UC Berkeley, I joined [UC Berkeley Ballroom Dancing][1] and quickly succumbed to [addiction][2].  After that, it was more and more, and I started salsa dancing two years into starting ballroom.  A year later, it was blues.  Now I've been dancing for 6 years now, and I don't see myself stopping anytime in the near future.  I'm still dancing ballroom and blues maybe.. 10 hours every week.

## Communication

Apologies in advance for the nerdiness that you come across.

For a long time, dancing with my ballroom dance partner was like writing code, submitting it, and then getting a code review immediately.  Then we'd argue about the validity of the comments, and then would have to resubmit it.

For a long time, it was because of not properly communicating the feature that we were trying to implement, so there was a lot of passive aggressiveness.  That arose from not wanting to be the one that couldn't fulfill the request, the one that couldn't dance well enough.  What we didn't realize was that we just really needed to agree on the features.  And in dance, features are things like: how to use space, energy, time, and weight, and more importantly, how to use them together.

What I've found for the most happy and efficient practice is to have limits on what we can bring up with each other, as well as giving constructive feedback.  We can't just go around bringing up random ideas; we can only bring up things that we are deliberately practicing.  Constructive feedback with good reference points also helps to reinforce certain dance concepts, like referring back to a good dance or a lesson.  You might think that this concept is really obvious, but you'd be surprised by how often when you don't know what you're doing wrong.

When we can't agree on what we should be doing in a particular figure or dance, we should be bring it up at a lesson.  We can't go too long without a lesson, or else we get strange ideas into our heads on what we should be doing.  The role of the instructor is to resolve these issues; otherwise we'll probably fuck it up somehow.  The other funny thing is that the teacher might tell you to do the same exact thing that your partner told you (and you probably didn't understand and responded badly), but he'll tell you do it with some nuance or perspective that your partner didn't have.

It took about two years for us to be able to speak the same dance language, but I think that we are much better at it now.  Communication is really just about what you want the other person to understand, and more importantly, how to negotiate what you want with them, so both of you can be happy.  Also if you can't agree on the things you want, feel free to explore new partnerships that satisfy your needs better.  (And yes, these are needs.)

## Balance

There are many different kinds of balance in ballroom dancing.  Personal balance, balance in the couple, balance in motion.

Personal balance is just your own balance, and you should be highly sensitive to when you are unbalanced.  You should be able to move freely in any direction from your standing foot while being relaxed.  We can define imbalance to be not just when your standing leg cannot support yourself, but also to be when your standing leg cannot *comfortably* support yourself.  This means that if any portion of your body feels tense when you're dancing, you're probably off balance, but not enough to tip over or fall.

Balance in the couple is coordinating your movement with your partner's.  This is really important because if this doesn't happen, then you will take your partner off balance.  And we all want to be balanced, because that is what looks and feels good in dance.  When there is couple balance, then they are sharing momentum, and this is the essense of dance: sharing a connection.  It is all the better when you have great lines when you're doing it.

How we achieve balance is through motion, and not through being static.  When you feel off balance, the easiest thing for you to do is to go along with it.  If you try to stay where you are, you'll spend a lot of energy trying to stay on your foot, and then the next steps won't have the same power or drive as you would have otherwise.  Then when you feel off balance, just go with it and then you have a better opportunity to recover.  The other important idea of balance in motion is that it will feel natural and effortless when you are doing that.  And that is how dance should feel.  You should not be trying to resist your body's movement, or else you'll take yourself off balance.  I may be repeating myself here, but they're very similar views on achieving balance through movement.

Here I've been talking about balance in your body (and your partner's), but I think this is really applicable to one's own life.  It's impossible to create couple balance if you don't have your personal balance, because you'll always be throwing your partner off.  It's important to keep moving to maintain balance, and to not be static.  It's important to always be growing and to be moving, whether it be forwards and backwards.  Never stay in the same place, or else you'll expend unnecessary energy getting to the next place, and you'll be more tired for it.

## Energy

When you dance, it's important to share your energy and momentum with your partner, or else you'll be using your arms to fight/argue about the direction in which you want to go.  By Newton's laws of motion, you're not really going to go anywhere if you're always fighting about direction and force.

The other part of energy that I want to address is the importance of moving yourself, and not making your partner move you.  You need to support yourself on your own legs.  You have mass, and you're also touching the floor.  You can use your own weight.  Nobody can be doing all the work in a partnership, and relying on your partner to pull your weight makes it really unpleasant and tiring for your partner.  You want to be the funnest, best person that they've ever danced with.  Well, to be more realistic, you want it to be a really good dance, so that they keep dancing with you.  I've heard an instructor say something similar in a blues class once:
You want your partner to feel like they're driving a Ferrari, not a car that won't start.

There's a pretty clear parallel to relationships here, I think.

## Some other topics

I've got some really short points that I'd like to make.

### Center

In dance, your center is how your partner knows where you are, and where you are headed.  This is how you sync two bodies together in motion.  You can try to do this with some random person, but it probably won't work unless both of you are super clear with your centers and intention.  If they can't feel your center, you can't possibly hope to stay with or dance with them.

I think this also goes for friendships and collaborations.  For deep and lasting relationships, it is important to be honest and for them to know exactly where you are.  You should be where/who you say you are.  If someone's center isn't clear, then it's really hard to gauge where to go from there, and at least one person is going to suffer the effects of bodily miscommunication.  This is different from the verbal communication that I mentioned earlier.

### Regarding social dance

Always be nice to your temporary partner and don't talk about their dancing abilities behind their back.  They might prove to be awesome partners later, and you're going to regret treating them badly.  Also it is just general courtesy.

Likewise, if your dance partner is physically hurting you with his lead, feel free not to dance with them in the future.  You can say no, and if you are the person getting turned down, it may not be personal, and don't take it personally.  There is always another dance to be had, and another person to dance it with.

## Conclusion

For some people, the joy of dancing ends with the dance, but there are many parallels to be had with living life.  Anyway, I hope you've enjoyed this read, and maybe you've learned something new.  You should consider taking up dance if you haven't already.   ;)
