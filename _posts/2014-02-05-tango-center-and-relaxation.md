It may sound counterintuitive to say that tango should feel relaxed, but that was the general topic of today.

How we achieve relaxation is through making our frame lower and more comfortable.  Our frame has been too high.  For a while, I have been sending the energy/pressure in my arms upward because I wanted to be sure that the droopiness of my partner's arms were not due to me.  But it looks far better when it is relaxed.

I have to be like a finely oiled machine, and be ready to move in any direction.  We still dance with too much drama, and need to balance personal power as well as staying together.  There's a metaphor for reality here!

Take everything with a grain of salt.  Any dance instruction may have applied right at that moment, but it may not apply a week later.  The process of teaching is just fine tuning the amount of things that you do.. like energy, direction, etc.

Teacher reiterated the importance of using head as a source of torque.  This is what we were missing from our tango practice on Saturday.  That is why the partner felt stopped, and could not get around me in the fallaway slip pivot.

Sometimes in tango, I feel like the partner feels too far away.  If we are standing and stretching, we should be able to meet and fit with each other.  We should check this when we are dancing.

Another aspect of relaxation and space is to not go seeking your partner in certain figures.  Dancing is dynamic because we are dynamic.  We can't both be going to the same place at the same time, or else we'll push each other off balance.  When getting into the reverse turn, you need to monitor your partner's closing from CBMP.  On the next step, you need to be on different tracks, and not be placed in a weird position to fit together.  At all times, someone should be able to step away from the figure and the other person should 1, be balanced, and 2, look fantastic.

Another thing about ballroom dance that I didn't fully understand (and perhaps about life as well) is that just because your head was not good here, doesn't mean that it was always bad.  I think in general I am too quick to defend myself, and not be able to isolate the criticism to the exact moment.  Just because it happened once doesn't mean that it always happens, and just because .

Tighter, fuller hold, but not stiff.  Just right.  That is incredibly hard to remember to do.

Don't stop the energy even if you change direction.

Importance of using hips to direct center and energy in tango.  Move your back, but keep your center to him.  Paying attention to hips when curving figures in tango.
