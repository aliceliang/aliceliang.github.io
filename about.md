  <a name="about-me" class="anchor" href="#about-me"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>about me</h3>

<p>I'm currently a software engineer at <a href="http://www.climate.com">The Climate Corporation</a>, based in San Francisco, CA.  I work on a distributed tracing system for our internal services, as well as ingesting lots of weather data for our researchers.  I studied Applied Mathematics with a focus on numerical analysis and Statistics at UC Berkeley.  I love to dance, bake, cook and read books in my spare time.</p>

<p>One of my side projects is writing posts for this site, and I'm trying to keep it at about 1 post a week.  Another side project of mine is practicing massage.  I took 100 hours of instruction for swedish massage <a href="http://www.mckinnonmassage.com/">here</a>, and I'm willing to trade massages for other goods and services. ;)  Another passion of mine is <a href="http://speakeasyalice.wordpress.com">traveling</a>!  The next big trip I'm planning is backpacking through South America this April.  I'll be flying into Lima, Peru and flying out of Buenos Aires, Argentina.</p>
