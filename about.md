  <a name="about-me" class="anchor" href="#about-me"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>about me</h3>

<p>I'm currently a software engineer at <a href="http://www.climate.com">The Climate Corporation</a>, based in San Francisco, CA.  I work on a distributed tracing system for our internal services, as well as ingesting lots of weather data for our researchers.</p>

<p>I studied Applied Mathematics with a focus on numerical analysis and Statistics at UC Berkeley.  I love to dance, bake, cook and read books in my spare time.  Another passion of mine is <a href="http://speakeasyalice.wordpress.com">traveling</a>.  The next big trip I'm planning is backpacking through South America this April.</p>
